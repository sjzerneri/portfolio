Mobile browsers like Fennec render pages in a virtual "window" (the viewport), usually wider than the screen, so they don't need to squeeze every page layout into a tiny window (which would break many non-mobile-optimized sites). Users can pan and zoom to see different areas of the page.
Mobile Safari introduced the "viewport meta tag" to let web developers control the viewport's size and scale. Many other mobile browsers now support this tag, although it is not part of any web standard.

        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>Im from Massachusetts, but spent 5 years in California before moving back to New York. I started in San Diego and then moved my way up to Los Angeles and San Francisco.</p>
        <p>I've worked at Raytheon as a financial analyst, Uber in operations and launch, and started an on demand moving company called Lugg.</p>

        <p>The hobby that’s currently taking up most of my time is this course! But I also love to play sports and get a workout in — its essential for my mental clarity.</p>

        <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
        <p> I grew up just outside of Boston, and spent a lot of time at my Grandparents farm in Western Massachusetts. I lived in San Diego for a year, Los Angeles for 3, San Francisco for a short time, and now I'm stationed in New York City.</p>
        <p>In short, I like to see as many new places as possible, as I think there's a ton of interesting cultures and experiences to learn from along the way.</p>

        <h2> What's your dream job?</h2>
        <p>I go back and forth. Part of me wants an independent job which would allow me to travel the world, while another part of me wants to lead a team and build a company with awesome culture and ethics.</p>
        <h2> What's your favorite type of music?</h2>
        <p>I usually listen to some instrumental music via my “Chillary Clinton” playlist, and I’ve always a fan of kenny chesney and eric church to take me back to my roots.</p>
